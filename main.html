    <h1>PPFL 2025</h1>
    <p>The International Conference on Building Secure and Scalable Privacy-Enhanced Federated Learning Systems</p>
      <br>

    <h1>About Us</h1><br>
    <p>Building secure and scalable privacy-enhanced federated learning systems involves creating architectures where multiple entities collaboratively
         train models while keeping their data localized, thus enhancing privacy. Such systems employ advanced cryptographic methods like homomorphic 
         encryption and differential privacy to ensure that individual data contributions remain confidential. 
         Scalability is addressed by optimizing communication protocols and data compression techniques to 
         handle large volumes of data efficiently across diverse networks. Additionally, robust anomaly detection
          mechanisms are integrated to safeguard against malicious participants and data poisoning. Implementing 
          decentralized governance models can further enhance trust and compliance with global data protection 
          regulations. The result is a federated system that not only respects user privacy but is also resilient and capable of 
          operating at scale, making it suitable for widespread adoption in sensitive industries like healthcare and finance.</p>
